# Advent of Code 2022 (Swift)
Advent of code, in Swift, by a non-coder (or at least a very very rusty coder)

This project uses Swift Playgrounds. You *should* be able to download it and run it in Xcode, but I honestly don't really understand how playgrounds work.

The input for each day is saved in a .txt file called `input.txt` which is stored in the Resources folder for the day's playgrounds page.
Some utility functions (like parsing the input file) are stored in `util.swift` under the Sources folder of the main Playground.
